# Don't restart. We only want to restart the search index or message broker
# in rare circumstances; when that happens, we can get our hands dirty.
#
# This is partially because message-broker is difficult to manage. Apollo's
# shutdown hook sometimes prevents shutdown altogether.

#sudo stop overview-search-index || true
#sudo stop overview-message-broker || true
#
#sleep 3
#
#sudo start overview-message-broker
#sudo start overview-search-index
#
# We do want a brand-new instance to start up, though:
sudo start overview-search-index || true
